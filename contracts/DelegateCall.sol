/**
  You may have noticed that the state variable start is used in both the library and them a in calling contract. 
  In the library contract, start is used to specify the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence and isset to 0,whereas 
  itisset to 3 in thecallingcontract.You may alsohavenoticedthatthefallbackfunctioninthe FibonacciBalance contract 
  allows all calls to be passed to the library contract, which allows for the setStart function of the library contract to be called.
  Recalling that we pre serve the state of the contract ,it may seem that this function would allow you to change the state of the start 
  variable in the local Fibonnacci Balance contract . If so, this would allow one to withdraw more ether, as the resulting calculated 
  Fib Number is dependent on the start variable (as seen in the library contract). the setStart function does not
   (and cannot) modify the start variable in the FibonacciBalance contract (different slots in both contracts). 
   The underlying vulnerability in this contract is significantly worse than just modifying the start variable.

   Incorrect State variables mapping between FibonacciBalance and Fibonacci

   The Fibonacci contract . It has two state variables , start and calculatedFibNumber.The first variable,start,is stored in th econtractâ€™s storageatslot[0](i.e.,the firstslot).
   The secondvariable, calculatedFibNumber, is placed in the next available storage slot, slot[1]
